  \section{Project Overview}
  We are going to develop an online integrated development environment(IDE) which allows users to code by draging and dropping different blocks of code to form a program, instead of typing. It is an IDE developed for users without previous experiences in coding to learn the basic of coding.
  \section{Objective}
  Programming has become a hot topic all over the world, including Hong Kong. And it is introduced to primary education in Hong Kong as a part of STEM education. However, the paradigm of programming equals to coding persists. And we do not think it is easy and interesting enough for 6-11 years old kids to learn programming through coding.

  In order to enhance the learning progress and increase their incentive to learn, we believe a new paradigm should be introduced to replace coding. Inspired by how LEGO\textsuperscript{\textregistered} Mindstorms\textsuperscript{\textregistered} programs, we believe a visualized drag and drop online programming platform will be more suitable to educational purpose when aiming at these young kids.

  We believe it is also an useful tool for rapid prototyping. Startupers without programming knowledge can use this programming IDE to start programming their software and applications with a lower difficulty. We also hope that this online IDE will also let programmers prototype their product at ease using pre-built function blocks in our online IDE.

  The Code Block Online IDE shall be a good platform for students to learn the basics of programming and a tool for programmers to rapid prototype their software and acheive a high code reuse rate.

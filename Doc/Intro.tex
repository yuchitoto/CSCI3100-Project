  \section{Introduction}
  \subsection{Project Overview}
  We are going to develop an online integrated development environment(IDE) which allows users to code by draging and dropping different blocks of code to form a program, instead of typing. It is an IDE developed for users without previous experiences in coding to learn the basic of coding.
  \subsection{Objective}
  Programming has become a hot topic all over the world, including Hong Kong. And it is introduced to primary education in Hong Kong as a part of STEM education. However, the paradigm of programming equals to coding persists. And we do not think it is easy and interesting enough for 6-11 years old kids to learn programming through coding.

  In order to enhance the learning progress and increase their incentive to learn, we believe a new paradigm should be introduced to replace coding. Inspired by how LEGO\textregistered Mindstorms\textregistered programs, we believe a visualized drag and drop online programming platform will be more suited to educational purpose.

%Drag and Drop System
This is the system provides dragging blocks and dropping onto the programming area for user to easily write program.\\
This system contains the following block:\\
	Variable Block, which is used to store data with a name given by user. The Variable Block contains the following type:\\
		Alphabet : only can store one alphabet for each variable.\\
		String : can store more than one alphabets with declared length of the variable.\\
		Integer : only can store integer.\\
		Real Number : can store real number with decimal point.\\
	Assignment Block, which is used to assign the data of one variable to another variable with the same type.\\
	Calculation Blocks, which can do addition, subtraction, multiplication and division with Variable Blocks which are in same type in the block and require a same type of Variable Block to store the result.
	IF Block, which is a logical block to do logical operations such as AND gate, OR gate and NOT gate. User can also do comparison between two Variable Blocks.\\
	ELSE Block, which is an optional block follow the IF Block and this block will only be run when the logical condition in the IF Block is false.\\
	Loop Block, which provides looping the blocks inside the Loop Block under a logical condition. This block begin with a IF Block and the blocks inside will starting looping until the condition in the IF Block is false.\\
	Input Block, which is used to get data and store to a suitable Variable Block while the program is running.\\
	Output Block, which is used to output text or data during program runtime.\\

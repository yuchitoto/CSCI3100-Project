\chapter{User Interface Design}
\section{Overview}
The user interface of Code Block Online IDE should be simple and easy to control. The user should be able to find what they want intuitively. Therefore a header is designed for easy access to different functions in the application. Under this principle, the overall user interface design concept is ``block", which is the main theme of the application. Every element in the application is in a form of a flowing block (except for the coding page). The flowing block design aims to let users focus on the content on the page.

\subsection{Header}
Header with a menu is appended on the top of every page. Only the main operations are shown to keep it clear. Under the option ``user", a submenu with more options will be displayed when the mouse is on hover.

\subsection{Form}
There are in total of three filling forms for account management in the application. Instant feedback should be given to the users if the form cannot be submitted and process. For example, a warning should be displayed if the input is invalid, and the processing message should be displayed after the form is submitted.

Project Lisa is an online tool which teach Object Oriented concepts to the users. This intuitive tool also helps the users be familierize with C++ syntaxes while they learn OOP concepts. C++ is a well-known high-level programming language which novice users may find bit difficult when it comes to understanding the complex models. Lisa is built for those who really need to understand what they are actually doing.

It is easy to use. Application is based on [Google Blockly API](https://developers.google.com/blockly/), which is a well known visual code generator. 

Students can drag and drop the building blocks to accomplish a given task. As it happens, real-time C++ code generated and shown to the user. This is really helpful to understand the map the coding syntaxes to visual blocks.
